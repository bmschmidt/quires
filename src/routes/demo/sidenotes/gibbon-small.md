If the subjects of Rome could be ignorant of their obligations to the
great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully the spirit
and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported the frail and
mouldering edifice of the republic. He died in the month of January; and
before the end of the winter of the same year, the Gothic nation was in
arms.[^1] The Barbarian auxiliaries
erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile
designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds. Their
countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of the last
treaty, to a life of tranquility and labor, deserted their farms at the
first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly resumed the weapons which they
had reluctantly laid down. The barriers of the Danube were thrown open;
the savage warriors of Scythia issued from their forests; and the
uncommon severity of the winter allowed the poet to remark, "that they
rolled their ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the
indignant river." [^2] The unhappy
natives of the provinces to the south of the Danube submitted to the
calamities, which, in the course of twenty years, were almost grown
familiar to their imagination; and the various troops of Barbarians, who
gloried in the Gothic name, were irregularly spread from woody shores of
Dalmatia, to the walls of Constantinople.
[^3] The interruption, or at least the
diminution, of the subsidy, which the Goths had received from the
prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the specious pretence of their
revolt: the affront was imbittered by their contempt for the unwarlike
sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was inflamed by the weakness,
or treachery, of the minister of Arcadius. The frequent visits of
Rufinus to the camp of the Barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected
to imitate, were considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty
correspondence, and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude
or of policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare
the private estates of the unpopular praefect. The Goths, instead of
being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their chiefs,
were now directed by the bold and artful genius of Alaric. That renowned
leader was descended from the noble race of the Balti;
[^4] which yielded only to the royal
dignity of the Amali: he had solicited the command of the Roman armies;
and the Imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their
refusal, and the importance of their loss. Whatever hopes might be
entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious general
soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. In the midst of a divided
court and a discontented people, the emperor Arcadius was terrified by
the aspect of the Gothic arms; but the want of wisdom and valor was
supplied by the strength of the city; and the fortifications, both of
the sea and land, might securely brave the impotent and random darts of
the Barbarians. Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate
and ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a
plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had hitherto
escaped the ravages of war.[^5]

    The revolt of the Goths, and the blockade of Constantinople, are
    distinctly mentioned by Claudian, (in Rufin. l. ii. 7-100,) Zosimus, (l.
    v. 292,) and Jornandes, (de Rebus Geticis, c. 29.)

    Claudian and Ovid often amuse their fancy by interchanging the metaphors
    and properties of liquid water, and solid ice. Much false wit has been
    expended in this easy exercise.

    bishop of Altinum, for the loss of his nephew, Nepotian, by a curious
    recapitulation of all the public and private misfortunes of the times.

    Baltha or bold: origo mirifica, says Jornandes, (c. 29.) This
    illustrious race long continued to flourish in France, in the Gothic
    province of Septimania, or Languedoc; under the corrupted appellation of
    Boax; and a branch of that family afterwards settled in the kingdom of
    Naples (Grotius in Prolegom. ad Hist. Gothic. p. 53.) The lords of Baux,
    near Arles, and of seventy-nine subordinate places, were independent of
    the counts of Provence, (Longuerue, Description de la France, tom. i. p.
    357).
