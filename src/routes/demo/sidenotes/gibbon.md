If the subjects of Rome could be ignorant of their obligations to the
great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully the spirit
and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported the frail and
mouldering edifice of the republic. He died in the month of January; and
before the end of the winter of the same year, the Gothic nation was in
arms.[^1] The Barbarian auxiliaries
erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile
designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds. Their
countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of the last
treaty, to a life of tranquility and labor, deserted their farms at the
first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly resumed the weapons which they
had reluctantly laid down. The barriers of the Danube were thrown open;
the savage warriors of Scythia issued from their forests; and the
uncommon severity of the winter allowed the poet to remark, "that they
rolled their ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the
indignant river." [^2] The unhappy
natives of the provinces to the south of the Danube submitted to the
calamities, which, in the course of twenty years, were almost grown
familiar to their imagination; and the various troops of Barbarians, who
gloried in the Gothic name, were irregularly spread from woody shores of
Dalmatia, to the walls of Constantinople.
[^3] The interruption, or at least the
diminution, of the subsidy, which the Goths had received from the
prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the specious pretence of their
revolt: the affront was imbittered by their contempt for the unwarlike
sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was inflamed by the weakness,
or treachery, of the minister of Arcadius. The frequent visits of
Rufinus to the camp of the Barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected
to imitate, were considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty
correspondence, and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude
or of policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare
the private estates of the unpopular praefect. The Goths, instead of
being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their chiefs,
were now directed by the bold and artful genius of Alaric. That renowned
leader was descended from the noble race of the Balti;
[^4] which yielded only to the royal
dignity of the Amali: he had solicited the command of the Roman armies;
and the Imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their
refusal, and the importance of their loss. Whatever hopes might be
entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious general
soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. In the midst of a divided
court and a discontented people, the emperor Arcadius was terrified by
the aspect of the Gothic arms; but the want of wisdom and valor was
supplied by the strength of the city; and the fortifications, both of
the sea and land, might securely brave the impotent and random darts of
the Barbarians. Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate
and ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a
plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had hitherto
escaped the ravages of war.[^5]

[^1]:
    The revolt of the Goths, and the blockade of Constantinople, are
    distinctly mentioned by Claudian, (in Rufin. l. ii. 7-100,) Zosimus, (l.
    v. 292,) and Jornandes, (de Rebus Geticis, c. 29.)

[^2]:

    > Alii per toga ferocis
    > Danubii solidata ruunt; expertaque remis
    > Frangunt stagna rotis.
    
    Claudian and Ovid often amuse their fancy by interchanging the metaphors
    and properties of liquid water, and solid ice. Much false wit has been
    expended in this easy exercise.

    bishop of Altinum, for the loss of his nephew, Nepotian, by a curious
    recapitulation of all the public and private misfortunes of the times.
    See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xii. p. 200, &c.

[^4]:
    Baltha or bold: origo mirifica, says Jornandes, (c. 29.) This
    illustrious race long continued to flourish in France, in the Gothic
    province of Septimania, or Languedoc; under the corrupted appellation of
    Boax; and a branch of that family afterwards settled in the kingdom of
    Naples (Grotius in Prolegom. ad Hist. Gothic. p. 53.) The lords of Baux,
    near Arles, and of seventy-nine subordinate places, were independent of
    the counts of Provence, (Longuerue, Description de la France, tom. i. p.
    357).

[^5]:
    Zosimus (l. v. p. 293-295) is our best guide for the conquest of
    Greece: but the hints and allusion of Claudian are so many rays of
    historic light.

The character of the civil and military officers, on whom Rufinus had
devolved the government of Greece, confirmed the public suspicion, that
he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and learning to the Gothic
invader. The proconsul Antiochus was the unworthy son of a respectable
father; and Gerontius, who commanded the provincial troops, was much
better qualified to execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant, than to
defend, with courage and ability, a country most remarkably fortified by
the hand of nature. Alaric had traversed, without resistance, the plains
of Macedonia and Thessaly, as far as the foot of Mount Oeta, a steep and
woody range of hills, almost impervious to his cavalry. They stretched
from east to west, to the edge of the sea-shore; and left, between the
precipice and the Malian Gulf, an interval of three hundred feet, which,
in some places, was contracted to a road capable of admitting only a
single carriage.[^6] In this narrow
pass of Thermopylae, where Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans had
gloriously devoted their lives, the Goths might have been stopped, or
destroyed, by a skilful general; and perhaps the view of that sacred
spot might have kindled some sparks of military ardor in the breasts of
the degenerate Greeks. The troops which had been posted to defend the
Straits of Thermopylae, retired, as they were directed, without
attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric;[^7]
and the fertile fields of Phocis
and Boeotia were instantly covered by a deluge of Barbarians who
massacred the males of an age to bear arms, and drove away the beautiful
females, with the spoil and cattle of the flaming villages. The
travellers, who visited Greece several years afterwards, could easily
discover the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths; and
Thebes was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her
seven gates, than to the eager haste of Alaric, who advanced to occupy
the city of Athens, and the important harbor of the Piraeus. The same
impatience urged him to prevent the delay and danger of a siege, by the
offer of a capitulation; and as soon as the Athenians heard the voice of
the Gothic herald, they were easily persuaded to deliver the greatest
part of their wealth, as the ransom of the city of Minerva and its
inhabitants. The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with
mutual fidelity. The Gothic prince, with a small and select train, was
admitted within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the
bath, accepted a splendid banquet, which was provided by the magistrate,
and affected to show that he was not ignorant of the manners of
civilized nations.[^8] But the whole
territory of Attica, from the promontory of Sunium to the town of
Megara, was blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the
comparison of a contemporary philosopher, Athens itself resembled the
bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim. The distance between
Megara and Corinth could not much exceed thirty miles; but the bad road,
an expressive name, which it still bears among the Greeks, was, or might
easily have been made, impassable for the march of an enemy. The thick
and gloomy woods of Mount Cithaeron covered the inland country; the
Scironian rocks approached the water's edge, and hung over the narrow
and winding path, which was confined above six miles along the
sea-shore.[^9] The passage of those
rocks, so infamous in every age, was terminated by the Isthmus of
Corinth; and a small a body of firm and intrepid soldiers might have
successfully defended a temporary intrenchment of five or six miles from
the Ionian to the Aegean Sea. The confidence of the cities of
Peloponnesus in their natural rampart, had tempted them to neglect the
care of their antique walls; and the avarice of the Roman governors had
exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province.[^10] Corinth, Argos, Sparta,
yielded without resistance to the arms of the Goths; and the most
fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by death, from beholding the
slavery of their families and the conflagration of their cities.[^11] The vases and statues were
distributed among the Barbarians, with more regard to the value of the
materials, than to the elegance of the workmanship; the female captives
submitted to the laws of war; the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of
valor; and the Greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse which
was justified by the example of the heroic times.[^12] The descendants of that
extraordinary people, who had considered valor and discipline as the
walls of Sparta, no longer remembered the generous reply of their
ancestors to an invader more formidable than Alaric. "If thou art a god,
thou wilt not hurt those who have never injured thee; if thou art a man,
advance:---and thou wilt find men equal to thyself."[^13] From Thermopylae to Sparta,
the leader of the Goths pursued his victorious march without
encountering any mortal antagonists: but one of the advocates of
expiring Paganism has confidently asserted, that the walls of Athens
were guarded by the goddess Minerva, with her formidable Aegis, and by
the angry phantom of Achilles;[^14]
and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence of the hostile
deities of Greece. In an age of miracles, it would perhaps be unjust to
dispute the claim of the historian Zosimus to the common benefit: yet it
cannot be dissembled, that the mind of Alaric was ill prepared to
receive, either in sleeping or waking visions, the impressions of Greek
superstition. The songs of Homer, and the fame of Achilles, had probably
never reached the ear of the illiterate Barbarian; and the Christian
faith, which he had devoutly embraced, taught him to despise the
imaginary deities of Rome and Athens. The invasion of the Goths, instead
of vindicating the honor, contributed, at least accidentally, to
extirpate the last remains of Paganism: and the mysteries of Ceres,
which had subsisted eighteen hundred years, did not survive the
destruction of Eleusis, and the calamities of Greece.[^15]

[^6]:
    Compare Herodotus (l. vii. c. 176) and Livy, (xxxvi. 15.) The narrow
    entrance of Greece was probably enlarged by each successive ravisher.

[^7]:
    He passed, says Eunapius, (in Vit. Philosoph. p. 93, edit. Commelin,
    1596,) through the straits, of Thermopylae.

[^8]:
    In obedience to Jerom and Claudian, (in Rufin. l. ii. 191,) I have
    mixed some darker colors in the mild representation of Zosimus, who
    wished to soften the calamities of Athens.

    > Nec fera Cecropias traxissent vincula matres.

    Synesius (Epist. clvi. p. 272, edit. Petav.) observes, that Athens,
    whose sufferings he imputes to the proconsul's avarice, was at that time
    less famous for her schools of philosophy than for her trade of honey.

[^9]:
    > Vallata mari Scironia rupes,
    > Et duo continuo connectens aequora muro
    > Isthmos.
    > —Claudian de Bel. Getico, 188.

    The Scironian rocks are described by Pausanias, (l. i. c. 44, p. 107,
    edit. Kuhn,) and our modern travellers, Wheeler (p. 436) and Chandler,
    (p. 298.) Hadrian made the road passable for two carriages.

[^10]:
    Claudian (in Rufin. l. ii. 186, and de Bello Getico, 611, &c.)
    vaguely, though forcibly, delineates the scene of rapine and
    destruction.

[^11]:
    These generous lines of Homer (Odyss. l. v. 306) were transcribed by
    one of the captive youths of Corinth: and the tears of Mummius may prove
    that the rude conqueror, though he was ignorant of the value of an
    original picture, possessed the purest source of good taste, a
    benevolent heart, (Plutarch, Symposiac. l. ix. tom. ii. p. 737, edit.
    Wechel.)

[^12]:
    Homer perpetually describes the exemplary patience of those female
    captives, who gave their charms, and even their hearts, to the murderers
    of their fathers, brothers, &c. Such a passion (of Eriphile for
    Achilles) is touched with admirable delicacy by Racine.

[^13]:
    Plutarch (in Pyrrho, tom. ii. p. 474, edit. Brian) gives the genuine
    answer in the Laconic dialect. Pyrrhus attacked Sparta with 25,000 foot,
    2000 horse, and 24 elephants, and the defence of that open town is a
    fine comment on the laws of Lycurgus, even in the last stage of decay.

[^14]: Such, perhaps, as Homer (Iliad, xx. 164) had so nobly painted him.
[^15]:
    Eunapius (in Vit. Philosoph. p. 90-93) intimates that a troop of
    monks betrayed Greece, and followed the Gothic camp. \* Note: The
    expression is curious: Vit. Max. t. i. p. 53, edit. Boissonade.---M.

The last hope of a people who could no longer depend on their arms,
their gods, or their sovereign, was placed in the powerful assistance of
the general of the West; and Stilicho, who had not been permitted to
repulse, advanced to chastise, the invaders of Greece.
[^16] A numerous fleet was equipped
in the ports of Italy; and the troops, after a short and prosperous
navigation over the Ionian Sea, were safely disembarked on the isthmus,
near the ruins of Corinth. The woody and mountainous country of Arcadia,
the fabulous residence of Pan and the Dryads, became the scene of a long
and doubtful conflict between the two generals not unworthy of each
other. The skill and perseverance of the Roman at length prevailed; and
the Goths, after sustaining a considerable loss from disease and
desertion, gradually retreated to the lofty mountain of Pholoe, near the
sources of the Peneus, and on the frontiers of Elis; a sacred country,
which had formerly been exempted from the calamities of war.[^17] The camp of the Barbarians was
immediately besieged; the waters of the river[^18] were diverted into another
channel; and while they labored under the intolerable pressure of thirst
and hunger, a strong line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their
escape. After these precautions, Stilicho, too confident of victory,
retired to enjoy his triumph, in the theatrical games, and lascivious
dances, of the Greeks; his soldiers, deserting their standards, spread
themselves over the country of their allies, which they stripped of all
that had been saved from the rapacious hands of the enemy. Alaric
appears to have seized the favorable moment to execute one of those
hardy enterprises, in which the abilities of a general are displayed
with more genuine lustre, than in the tumult of a day of battle. To
extricate himself from the prison of Peloponnesus, it was necessary that
he should pierce the intrenchments which surrounded his camp; that he
should perform a difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles, as far
as the Gulf of Corinth; and that he should transport his troops, his
captives, and his spoil, over an arm of the sea, which, in the narrow
interval between Rhium and the opposite shore, is at least half a mile
in breadth.[^19] The operations of
Alaric must have been secret, prudent, and rapid; since the Roman
general was confounded by the intelligence, that the Goths, who had
eluded his efforts, were in full possession of the important province of
Epirus. This unfortunate delay allowed Alaric sufficient time to
conclude the treaty, which he secretly negotiated, with the ministers of
Constantinople. The apprehension of a civil war compelled Stilicho to
retire, at the haughty mandate of his rivals, from the dominions of
Arcadius; and he respected, in the enemy of Rome, the honorable
character of the ally and servant of the emperor of the East.

[^16]:
    For Stilicho's Greek war, compare the honest narrative of Zosimus (l.
    v. p. 295, 296) with the curious circumstantial flattery of Claudian,
    (i. Cons. Stilich. l. i. 172-186, iv. Cons. Hon. 459-487.) As the event
    was not glorious, it is artfully thrown into the shade.

[^17]:
    The troops who marched through Elis delivered up their arms. This
    security enriched the Eleans, who were lovers of a rural life. Riches
    begat pride: they disdained their privilege, and they suffered. Polybius
    advises them to retire once more within their magic circle. See a
    learned and judicious discourse on the Olympic games, which Mr. West has
    prefixed to his translation of Pindar.

[^18]:
    Claudian (in iv. Cons. Hon. 480) alludes to the fact without naming
    the river; perhaps the Alpheus, (i. Cons. Stil. l. i. 185.)

    ```{xml:space="preserve"}
      —-Et Alpheus Geticis angustus acervis
        Tardior ad Siculos etiamnum pergit amores.
    ```

    Yet I should prefer the Peneus, a shallow stream in a wide and deep bed,
    which runs through Elis, and falls into the sea below Cyllene. It had
    been joined with the Alpheus to cleanse the Augean stable. (Cellarius,
    tom. i. p. 760. Chandler's Travels, p. 286.)

A Grecian philosopher,[^20] who
visited Constantinople soon after the death of Theodosius, published his
liberal opinions concerning the duties of kings, and the state of the
Roman republic. Synesius observes, and deplores, the fatal abuse, which
the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the
military service. The citizens and subjects had purchased an exemption
from the indispensable duty of defending their country; which was
supported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. The fugitives of Scythia
were permitted to disgrace the illustrious dignities of the empire;
their ferocious youth, who disdained the salutary restraint of laws,
were more anxious to acquire the riches, than to imitate the arts, of a
people, the object of their contempt and hatred; and the power of the
Goths was the stone of Tantalus, perpetually suspended over the peace
and safety of the devoted state. The measures which Synesius recommends,
are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot. He exhorts the emperor
to revive the courage of his subjects, by the example of manly virtue;
to banish luxury from the court and from the camp; to substitute, in the
place of the Barbarian mercenaries, an army of men, interested in the
defence of their laws and of their property; to force, in such a moment
of public danger, the mechanic from his shop, and the philosopher from
his school; to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure,
and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the
laborious husbandman. At the head of such troops, who might deserve the
name, and would display the spirit, of Romans, he animates the son of
Theodosius to encounter a race of Barbarians, who were destitute of any
real courage; and never to lay down his arms, till he had chased them
far away into the solitudes of Scythia; or had reduced them to the state
of ignominious servitude, which the Lacedaemonians formerly imposed on
the captive Helots.[^21] The court
of Arcadius indulged the zeal, applauded the eloquence, and neglected
the advice, of Synesius. Perhaps the philosopher who addresses the
emperor of the East in the language of reason and virtue, which he might
have used to a Spartan king, had not condescended to form a practicable
scheme, consistent with the temper, and circumstances, of a degenerate
age. Perhaps the pride of the ministers, whose business was seldom
interrupted by reflection, might reject, as wild and visionary, every
proposal, which exceeded the measure of their capacity, and deviated
from the forms and precedents of office. While the oration of Synesius,
and the downfall of the Barbarians, were the topics of popular
conversation, an edict was published at Constantinople, which declared
the promotion of Alaric to the rank of master-general of the Eastern
Illyricum. The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had respected the
faith of treaties, were justly indignant, that the ruin of Greece and
Epirus should be so liberally rewarded. The Gothic conqueror was
received as a lawful magistrate, in the cities which he had so lately
besieged. The fathers, whose sons he had massacred, the husbands, whose
wives he had violated, were subject to his authority; and the success of
his rebellion encouraged the ambition of every leader of the foreign
mercenaries. The use to which Alaric applied his new command,
distinguishes the firm and judicious character of his policy. He issued
his orders to the four magazines and manufactures of offensive and
defensive arms, Margus, Ratiaria, Naissus, and Thessalonica, to provide
his troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords, and
spears; the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the instruments
of their own destruction; and the Barbarians removed the only defect
which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of their courage.[^22] The birth of Alaric, the glory
of his past exploits, and the confidence in his future designs,
insensibly united the body of the nation under his victorious standard;
and, with the unanimous consent of the Barbarian chieftains, the
master-general of Illyricum was elevated, according to ancient custom,
on a shield, and solemnly proclaimed king of the Visigoths.[^23] Armed with this double power,
seated on the verge of the two empires, he alternately sold his
deceitful promises to the courts of Arcadius and Honorius; till he
declared and executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the
West. The provinces of Europe which belonged to the Eastern emperor,
were already exhausted; those of Asia were inaccessible; and the
strength of Constantinople had resisted his attack. But he was tempted
by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of Italy, which he had twice
visited; and he secretly aspired to plant the Gothic standard on the
walls of Rome, and to enrich his army with the accumulated spoils of
three hundred triumphs.[^25]

    Synesius passed three years (A.D. 397-400) at Constantinople, as
    deputy from Cyrene to the emperor Arcadius. He presented him with a
    crown of gold, and pronounced before him the instructive oration de
    Regno, (p. 1-32, edit. Petav. Paris, 1612.) The philosopher was made
    bishop of Ptolemais, A.D. 410, and died about 430. See Tillemont, Mem.
    Eccles. tom. xii. p. 490, 554, 683-685.

    within the term which has been rashly fixed the interpreters escaped
